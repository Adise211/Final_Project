Goal:  
To create app where users could save money for long or short period of time. The user can decide for how long and how much money he/she would like to save , in order to reach that goal the app will help the users step by step toward his goal. 




Details: 
First, the user need to sign-up and complete some questions like; name, email, phone number, how much you want to save per month etc. Second, the user will get email/sms in order to complete his/her registering. Third, guide how to use the app and start to use it.



Tools: 
For the back-end I want to use postgreSQL, node, express and more. 
For front-end I want to use JavaScript, REACT, REACT-NATIVE and more.
